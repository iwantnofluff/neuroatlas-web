/**
 * Real gltfjsx export of the NA·01 sensor module (public/band.glb),
 * replacing the earlier <Torus> placeholder used in BuiltToReadYouScene.
 * The source file has no semantic names at all — every mesh is
 * "empty_2".."empty_12" and every material is unnamed too (confirmed by
 * parsing the GLB's own JSON chunk directly, not just gltfjsx's
 * generated output) — so mesh identity here is inferred from actual
 * geometry rather than assumed from a name: the two largest-vertex-count
 * meshes are the module's front/back shell (the "Main Band" surface per
 * the brief — leaning into a "core module" read, the precision housing
 * around the sensor), the other nine are small hardware details (lugs,
 * pins, buttons — the "Clasp/Hardware Accents").
 *
 * Scale: the source is modeled in real-world meters (~2.5cm bounding
 * box) — ×18 brings it in line with this scene's existing unit
 * conventions (the camera/lighting rig assume ~1–2 unit sized objects,
 * matching BandModel.tsx elsewhere in this codebase) at a size that
 * sits between/slightly over the "BUILT TO READ YOU" letters behind it
 * rather than blotting them out entirely (×30 read as a flat black box
 * censoring the whole headline). ×18 is tuned for desktop specifically
 * though — on a ~375px phone the same world-scale object fills a much
 * bigger share of the (much narrower) frame, and ends up covering most
 * of both text lines instead of sitting between them (confirmed via
 * screenshot, not assumed). `isMobile` drops it to ×10 below the 768px
 * breakpoint to compensate — a plain prop, not a CSS class, since
 * Tailwind's responsive variants have no reach into a Three.js scale
 * prop at all.
 *
 * One of the two shell meshes has inverted normals (invisible when
 * solid-filled from most angles — confirmed by isolating it with a
 * wireframe material, where it rendered fine, versus solid fill, where
 * it didn't). `side: THREE.DoubleSide` on both materials sidesteps this
 * rather than patching that one mesh's winding order specifically —
 * costs nothing visually on an opaque object, and covers either shell
 * if the export changes again.
 *
 * Shell color is a lighter, slightly desaturated navy (not the near-
 * black #0A0F1D this started with) at lower roughness/higher metalness
 * — #0A0F1D with roughness 0.8 absorbed essentially all incoming light,
 * reading as a flat 2D silhouette rather than a lit 3D object; this
 * combination actually catches the rig's rim/fill lights.

// Desktop 22 (was 18) — the "Built To"/"Read You" sandwich (see
// BuiltToReadYouSection.tsx) now closes its text blocks together at the
// exact vertical center instead of leaving a large empty gap around the
// model; at the old scale the model read as too small for that tighter
// space ("a bit lost in the gap"). +22% is enough to intentionally
// overlap both lines' inner edges without swallowing them.
//
// Mobile — NOTE this value's history only makes sense in light of
// BuiltToReadYouSection.tsx's OWN history: 8 was tuned down from 10
// specifically to stop the model overlapping/obscuring the old mobile
// "sandwich" headline (confirmed live at the time: 10-12 swallowed
// enough of both lines that "BUILT TO"/"READ YOU" stopped reading as
// words). Mobile no longer uses that layout at all — it now gets an
// ordinary top-anchored two-line headline with the model free in the
// untouched middle of the screen (see that file's mobile-only block),
// so there's nothing left for the model to avoid overlapping. At the
// old value of 8 it read as too small and lost in that now-empty
// middle (client feedback, live: "tighten up the space around the 3D
// model, make it bigger, maybe it's too small on a narrow device").
// 20 — well past the old text-avoidance ceiling — is what actually
// reads as a confident focal object filling that space rather than a
// small thing floating in a big void; checked live on iPhone 14 and SE
// that it still clears the headline above and subtext below with no
// overlap at any point in the scroll (position/rotation change, scale
// doesn't).

 *  - "reveal" (default, BuiltToReadYouSection's exact original behavior,
 *    untouched): `t` ramps 0→1 across just the first 40% of the scroll
 *    range then clamps at 1, so the model rises from off-screen while
 *    completing one full turn, then locks in place for the rest of the
 *    scroll — the "position -5→0, rotation 0→2π, then holds" sequence.
 *  - "showcase" (BandScrollShowcase): the model is already fully visible
 *    from the start (no rise — position.y stays 0 throughout), and
 *    rotation continuously eases through SHOWCASE_POSE_KEYFRAMES above
 *    instead.
 *
 *  `scale` overrides the isMobile-based MODEL_SCALE_DESKTOP/MOBILE
 *  ternary entirely when supplied — those two constants were tuned
 *  specifically for BuiltToReadYouSection's full-bleed canvas;
 *  BandScrollShowcase's model sits in a much smaller, differently-framed
